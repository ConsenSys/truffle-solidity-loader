## truffle-solidity-loader

A Webpack loader allows importing a solidity contract that return a truffle artifact json object. This allows you to develop your contracts with Hot Reloading support, and have your migrations automatically re-run on change. When you run a production build, the contracts will be bundled into your main bundle for easy deployment.

## Example

```javascript
var provider = new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("http://localhost:8545");
var contract = require("truffle-contract");

// Instead of including a built json file
import myContract_artifacts from '../build/contracts/MyContract.json'
var MyContract = contract(myContract_artifacts)

//You can import the solidity contract directly
import myContract_artifacts from '../contracts/MyContract.sol'
var MyContract = contract(myContract_artifacts)

MyContract.setProvider(provider);
```

You can see this plugin in operation in the [Truffle+Webpack Demo App](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-webpack-demo). The demo is for truffle 2.0.

## Installation

`$ npm install --save-dev truffle-solidity-loader json-loader`

Add the appropriate config to your `loaders` section of your Webpack 2 config:

```javascript
{
  test: /\.sol/,
  use: [
    { loader: 'json-loader' },
    { loader: 'truffle-solidity-loader?network=development' }
  ]
}
```

Webpack applies loaders [right to left](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/#pitching-loader), therefore the output of `truffle-solidity-loader` goes into `json-loader`. The `network` parameter must be set, otherwise you get an error.


### `truffle.js` integration

The loader will detect a `truffle.js` (or `truffle-config.js` for Windows users) config file in your project and use that for configuration.

Importantly, you will need to specify the location of your `migrations` directory in the `truffle.js` file like so:

`"migrations_directory": "./migrations"`

You can also override the Truffle config using a loader querystring as outlined below:

```javascript
{
  test: /\.sol/,
  use: [
    { loader: 'json-loader' },
    { loader: 'truffle-solidity-loader?migrations_directory=' + path.resolve(__dirname, './migrations') + '&network=development' }
  ]
}
```

If you don't want to set query parameters, you can provide a `json` object.

```javascript
{
  test: /\.sol/,
  use: [
    { loader: 'json-loader' },
    { loader: 'truffle-solidity-loader',
      options: {
        migrations_directory: path.resolve(__dirname, './migrations'),
        network: 'development'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


### Loader Query string config

  - `migrations_directory`: The path to a directory containing your Truffle migrations
  - `network`: A network name to use
  - `network_id`: A network id to use
  - `contracts_build_directory`: Where do you want the created json file to exist?
